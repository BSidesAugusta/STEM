#BSidesAugusta STEM
BSidesAugusta STEM is a conference focused on developing interest in computers, programming, and electronics in the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA).  In the primary track, local youth will learn skills for the future through fun and innovative activities.  The conference also offers a secondary track for educators and parents interested in supporting skill development in a variety of academic settings.

Track 1: STEM for Kids
This exciting track is designed to teach children, grades 7-10, to interface with a Raspberry Pi and peripherals.  Students will learn to setup the Raspberry Pi hardware, configure the Raspian Operating System, connect General Input/Output devices, and program the operating system to interact with those devices.  Students will spend the afternoon in a team practical application exercise.  

Track 2:  Educator and Parent Track
This track is for educators and parents who want to learn more about information technology and security education.  The SANS Cyber Aces program will be introduced as a training platform to education students in information technology subject areas.  The track also consists of foundation classes on computer networking, operating systems, safe online practices, scripting, and programming.  Each class will include education on the subject and open source reference to use in academic settings.
